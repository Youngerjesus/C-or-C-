As we discussed in Set 1, following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:
1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure


2) Optimal Substructure: A given problems has Optimal Substructure Property if optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems.


Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.
